# 📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis | Power BI
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze Blinkit’s sales performance, outlet efficiency, and product trends. The dashboard converts raw retail data into actionable insights to support data-driven business decisions in the quick-commerce sector.
