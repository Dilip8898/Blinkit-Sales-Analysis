🚀 I'm thrilled to share my latest project where I developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for Blinkit, a leading last-minute grocery delivery service in India. This dashboard provides valuable insights into various business metrics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions to optimize performance and enhance customer experience.
